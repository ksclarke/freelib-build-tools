# Security Policy

This project defines a set of plugins and configuration patterns that are used by other FreeLibrary projects. These are used in Maven builds of other projects, not in the code of other projects, but still might introduce vulnerabilities through the build process. The versions of the plugins in the project are kept up to date through manual and automated security scans.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you notice a vulnerability that has not been caught by our manual or automated scans, please contact <a href="mailto:ksclarke@ksclarke.io">Kevin S. Clarke</a> directly. It will help if you preface the email's subject with "SECURITY: ".

Thank you!
