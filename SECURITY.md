# Security Policy

This project defines a set of plugins and configuration patterns that are used by other FreeLibrary projects. These are used in Maven builds, not in the code of other projects, but still might introduce vulnerabilities through the build process. To try and prevent this, this project's plugin versions are kept up to date through manual and automated security scans.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you notice a vulnerability that has not been caught by the manual or automated scans, please contact <a href="mailto:ksclarke@ksclarke.io">Kevin S. Clarke</a> directly. It will help if you preface the email's subject with "SECURITY: ".

Thank you!
